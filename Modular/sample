Our app uses Redis via EasyCaching, and serialization format impacts both performance and payload size. Right now we use JSON serialization, which is human-readable but less efficient.

MessagePack is a compact binary format thatâ€™s well-supported in .NET and in EasyCaching. It typically offers faster serialization/deserialization and smaller payloads, which can reduce Redis network and memory overhead.

We should research the effort to switch from JSON to MessagePack in our Redis cache layer, test performance improvements, and update configuration if the gains are significant.
