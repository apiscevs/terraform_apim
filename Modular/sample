# Scripts for APIM Setup

## Hard Link Setup for Swagger File

### Purpose
This script (`setup-swagger-link-local-dev.bat`) creates a **hard link** for the Swagger file to avoid manual copying while keeping a **single source of truth**.

### Why?
- The **Swagger file belongs to the API project** and should stay there.
- **APIM is API-agnostic** but needs the Swagger file for local development.
- In **Jenkins**, the file will be **copied before packaging**, ensuring consistency.

### How to Use
After cloning the repository, run:

#### **Windows**
```cmd
setup-swagger-link-local-dev.bat
