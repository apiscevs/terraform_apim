<As a> Developer preparing JMeter tests for MQ workflows
<I would like to> have basic scaffolding in place to authenticate and connect to MQ reliably
<So that> I can focus on building and running business-specific test scenarios without being blocked by technical connection issues


Acceptance Criteria:
A JMeter Test Plan exists that successfully authenticates and connects to the MQ environment.

Connection and authentication logic are implemented in a modular way to allow reuse in business-specific scenarios.

Any technical obstacles (such as missing credentials, network access problems, or unexpected MQ errors) are identified and documented.

No errors are encountered when executing a simple MQ connection validation test.
