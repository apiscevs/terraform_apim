Hi everyone,

As the year comes to an end, my time working with you is most likely coming to a close as well. While nothing is fully set in stone yet, it looks like my contract will end at the end of the year, so I wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you.

It really was a great time working with you all. Despite already being pretty much “old” by tech standards, I’m genuinely glad I still had the opportunity to learn a few new things along the way — and to be part of the preparations for what’s coming next.

I appreciate the collaboration and the conversations we’ve had over the past year, and I wish you all the best as the work continues. Hopefully our paths cross again somewhere down the line.

On the brighter side, there will be no more broken builds coming from my side 😄

All the best,
[Your Name]
