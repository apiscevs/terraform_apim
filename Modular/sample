This test suite builds upon the original JMeter scenarios developed in 2023. In 2025, we began extending it to cover additional endpoints and business flows, with a dual purpose: to support performance validation during development and to track system performance trends over time. The evolving suite helps us detect regressions, benchmark improvements, and ensure continued scalability.
