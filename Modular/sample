Description:
Our app is performance-critical and currently uses Azure Cosmos DB. The SDK supports two connection modes:

Gateway mode (HTTPS, port 443) → simpler but higher latency.

Direct mode (TCP) → lower latency and better throughput, but needs open outbound ports and may require infra adjustments.

We should research which mode we’re using now, test the impact of Direct mode, and update configuration if it gives us measurable performance improvements.

Notes:

Direct mode is generally recommended for production workloads.
