I went through the existing code and got a better sense of how ME is working. I also reviewed your branch—it looks like a POC with some issues scattered around. While I can trace what was changed, it's hard to tell what’s missing or unfinished, which makes it difficult to confidently build on top of it.

Given that, I believe it would be more efficient to start a clean POC from scratch. That way, I can fully understand the flow and ensure everything is functioning correctly.

At this point, I’d prefer not to provide even a rough estimate. Since we’ll likely uncover more edge cases and problem areas during a fresh POC, estimating now would be premature.

Here's the plan I suggest:

Build a new POC from scratch to understand the scope and fix any foundational issues.

Re-assess and provide realistic estimates based on what we uncover during the POC.

Meanwhile, someone else can start working on manual integration tests to verify the current behavior and later validate the refactored version.

Let me know if that works for you.
